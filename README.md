📊 Data Analysis with Pandas & Visualization with Matplotlib
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to analyze and visualize a dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in Python.
We use the Iris dataset (a classic dataset in machine learning) to:

Load and explore data

Perform basic statistical analysis

Group and compare values

Visualize results with different chart types

🛠️ Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

🚀 How to Run

Clone or download the project.

Save the script as script.py.

Run the script:

python script.py


The script will:

Print dataset info and summary statistics

Perform basic analysis

Show 4 different plots (line, bar, histogram, scatter)

📊 Visualizations Generated

Line Chart – Sepal length across samples

Bar Chart – Average petal length per species

Histogram – Sepal width distribution

Scatter Plot – Sepal length vs. petal length

✅ Observations

Setosa flowers have the smallest sepal length on average.

Virginica flowers tend to have the largest petals.

Sepal length and petal length are positively correlated.

The dataset contains no missing values.
